The Red Cross CBS project is an open-source community driven project. Anyone with an interest in the project can join the community and contribute to the project design. All community members are expected to follow the [code of conduct](https://cbsrc.org/contribute/codeofconduct/).

## Roles and Responsibilities

## Users

The users are Red Cross Red Crescent community-based volunteers, who are reporting on health risks. There are over 17 million Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers in the world, all working towards improving the health of their communities. Selected RCRC National Societies are contributing to the development by pilot testing the platform. In the future, more and more Red Cross volunteers worldwide will become users. The experiences of these users are fed back to the developers to ensure that we are fulfilling their needs.

## Contributors

CBS contributors are tech-community members who contribute in concrete ways to the project. Anyone can become a contributor, and contributions can take many forms. Contributors may find themselves doing one or more of the following:

* supporting new users (existing users are often the best people to support new users)

* reporting bugs

* identifying requirements

* providing graphics and web design

* programming

* assisting with project infrastructure

* writing documentation

* fixing bugs

* adding features

Contributors engage with the project through the issues identified on GitHub. They submit changes to the project via pull requests, which will be considered for inclusion in the project by the core team and the tech lead. If a contributor needs help when making a first contribution, questions may be asked on the slack group or directly to the tech lead.

As contributors gain experience and familiarity with the project, their profile within, and commitment to, the community will increase. At some stage, they may find themselves being nominated for the core team.

## Core team

The key difference between a contributor and a core team member is that the core team member takes a larger role in decision making, issue creation and prioritization within the project, and also has the mandate to accept pull-requests from committers. Core team members’ work continues to be reviewed by the community before acceptance through pull requests.

Anyone can become a core team member; there are no special requirements other than to have shown a willingness to the project, normally over a period of time. New core team members are democratically voted in by current core team members and the tech lead. 

New core team members can be nominated at any time. New core team members may decline their nomination. However, this is unusual, as the project does not expect any specific time or resource commitment from its members. The intention behind the role of the core team is to allow people to contribute to the project in a more overarching way, not to tie them in to the project in any formal way. Under normal circumstances, core team membership exists for as long as the committer wishes to continue engaging with the project.

Current core team members are:

* Alexander Hoset

* Bjørn Fossan Rasmussen

* Einar Ingebrigtsen

* Hodo Elmi

* Jakob Høgenes

* Karoline Klever

* Sindre Alstad Wilting

## Tech Lead

The tech lead is the NorCross employee responsible for the technological progress of the project. The tech lead holds executive decision making power. When a contributor has a concern, question or comment of technical nature, he/she is always welcome to discuss this with the tech lead.

The current tech lead is Samson Geijbo (samson.geijbo@redcross.no)

Domain Experts/Project lead Domain experts are typically appointed by the Red Cross and are a group of health experts who inform and support the development of the CBS project. The domain expert team is led by the Project Lead. Domain experts may make requests for edits or new requests to the contributors on how the CBS software needs to be for simplest/best use by users.

The current project lead is Anine Kongelf (anine.kongelf@redcross.no)

## Activity Coordinator 

The activity coordinator supports the coordination of the development of the software. This includes providing support to contributors, core team, tech lead, domain experts and project lead to ensure that the progress of the software development is well coordinated (for instance through contact with contributors, organisation of events, on boarding of new contributors etc.) The activity coordinator is appointed by the Red Cross, and is a full time position. 

When a contributor has a concern, question or comment, he/she is always welcome to discuss this with the activity coordinator. 

The current activity coordinator is Rebecca M. Bushby (rebecca.madeleine.bushby@redcross.no) 

## Support 

All participants in the community are encouraged to provide support for new users within the project, although the initial on boarding and support falls under the responsibility of the activity coordinator, tech lead and core team.  

## Decision Making Process 

Decisions about the future of the project are made through the core team and by the tech lead. Although the tech lead may seek consensus within the core team (to be sought during the Wednesday syncs), he/she may also make executive decisions. Local needs of users will be the determining factor of any choice.  

Any community member can make a proposal for consideration. In order to initiate a discussion about a new idea, they should send an email to the tech lead. This will prompt a review by the tech lead (and potentially the core team) and, if necessary, a discussion of the idea. The goal of this review and discussion is to gain approval for the contribution. Since most people in the project community have a shared vision, there is often little need for discussion in order to reach consensus.
