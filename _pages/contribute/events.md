- ### Code evening February 6th 
Our code evenings take place from 16.30-21.00 at the (Norwegian Red Cross' offices)[https://goo.gl/maps/YfpGe5vTgn92]. The code evenings are a chance for our contributors (both new and experienced) to meet up to work on the CBS project. We provide food and drinks and you provide the programming brains! Representatives from the Red Cross are of course also present to guide you through the domain and help you to find tasks.
