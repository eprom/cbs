*Do you have knowledge related to software development, coding, user interfaces, graphic design or marketing? Are you eager to learn more? Do you want to help us save lives?* 

We are looking for engaged volunteers to contribute to the development of our community based surveillance platform. Whether you are a tech buff, a coding enthusiast, an advertising talent or a graphics aficionado â€“ **we need your help!** 

**What can you expect?** 

During the two-day codeathon we will be working on improving the MVP which is currently being piloted by the Somali Red Crescent Society and getting the system ready to scale-up to more pilot countries. As a Codeathon participant, you will join a team where you will work on pre-defined issues to help us get one step closer to solving an important humanitarian need. Your team will consist of health experts, CBS platform experts and other developers (both new CBS contributors and experienced ones!) *This is a great opportunity to meet new people, play with new technology, work in a dynamic and interesting team - all while saving lives!*

You will hear exiting presentations, simulate and test the CBS system, have a fun community dinner (with entertainment!), get the chance to attend break out sessions with great learning opportunities and much, much more!
