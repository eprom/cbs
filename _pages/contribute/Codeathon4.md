*Do you have knowledge related to software development, coding, user interfaces or graphic design? Are you eager to learn more? Do you want to help us save lives?* 

We are looking for engaged volunteers to contribute to the development of our community based surveillance platform. Whether you are a tech buff, a coding enthusiast or a graphics aficionado – **we need your help!** 

**What can you expect?** 

During the two-day codeathon, you will be helping us improve on the CBS platform MVP which is currently live in Somaliland. The CBS platform follows the domain-driven design pattern where each “bounded context” acts as a microservice. The communication between the bounded contexts is event-driven, and within each microservice the frontend is based on React (some parts are still being rewritten from Angular), with a .NET Core backend and MongoDb for storage. They are dockerized and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster, with Kafka as the event hub. The analytics bounded context is built with R and D3js. 

As a Codeathon participant, you will join a team where you work with experienced CBS contributors and the Red Cross to help us get one step closer to solving an important humanitarian need. Your team will consist of health experts, CBS platform experts, developers, designers, PMs and data analysis. *This is a great opportunity to meet new people, play with new technology, work in a dynamic and interesting team - all while saving lives!*

During the codeathon you will be joined by Nikolai Astrup, the Norwegian Minister for International Development, as well as leading health and technical development experts. You will hear exiting presentations, simulate and test the CBS system, have a fun community dinner (with entertainment!), get the chance to attend break out sessions with great learning opportunities and much, much more!
