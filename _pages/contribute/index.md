The Norwegian Red Cross (NorCross) understands humanitarian health needs and risks. However we need technical support to create our CBS platform. With the support of the bright minds of our tech volunteers, we have created a pilot of the CBS platform which is live in Somalia. We are constantly looking for engaged volunteers to contribute to the development of our community based surveillance platform. 

Whether you are a tech buff, a coding enthusiast, an advertising talent or a graphics aficionado – we need your help to save lives! 

As a volunteer you are free to choose how you want to contribute – whether it contributing five minutes here and there from home or at work, making it your life mission to build the CBS system, or by joining one of our events.  

*There are several ways to start contributing.*  
- [Contact us](https://cbsrc.org/contactus/) to find out how you can best get started.  
- Sign up for one of our [Events](https://cbsrc.org/contribute/events/)
