As a humanitarian organization, the Norwegian Red Cross (NorCross) understands humanitarian health needs and risks. NorCross is supporting many ongoing health programs and projects in different countries and also respond to emergencies with field hospitals and public health experts. Lately, NorCross has taken the lead to develop a platform for community based surveillance. We have the health knowledge and activities in place to detect epidemic prone diseases in the communities and the collaboration to respond, but we need the technical support to create a platform that makes the communication between these quick and easy. 

With the support of bright minds on programming, coding, software-building and user experience we currently have an operational MVP being piloted in Somalia. 

### We are constantly looking for engaged volunteers to contribute to the development of our community based surveillance platform. Whether you are a tech buff, a coding enthusiast, an advertising talent or a graphics aficionado – we need your help to save lives!
